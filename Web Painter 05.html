	Great work so far - this tutorial builds on all the work done you've completed so far and provides an excellent starting point to try to solve some more complex problems assocated with the canvas.  Before you start - don't forget to enable the console

	An important note and something to think about:
		Well done, you've solved a number of different issues - by now you should start to notice a pattern especially the colour selectors, e.g. accept an input, set a variable, use the
		variable to action a change (you should also now realise that you could design as many different colour selectors as you like and use them without a significant change to your code).



	Tasks:
		1. Spend some time reviewing this code - try to make sure you understand what is happening and why.
		2. Get this program running in Chrome and test it; make sure you have enabled the console and can see the "Debug Messages".
		3. Check how we fixed the painting in the wrong place 
		4. Re-add the missing 2 colour selectors
		5. Add tools to change the brush size (allow for three sizes); HINT, use the same approach as the colour selectors.
		6. Add a tool to reset the canvas to the currently selected colour; HINT, you know how to reset the canvas - so now just use the selected colour
		7. Add some way to "show" the user the selected colour and brush size; each of the selector tools has a black border - consider using JavaScript to change the border to a 
			different colour to show which ones are selected
	
		Try to complete the tasks before the next session

					by adding "event" to the function call means that we will be able to access mouse and keyboard information, really useful!! 
					it is best practice to set the size of the canvas using the width="xx" and height="xx" because by default, if not specified the 
					size will be 300px x 150px and any drawing will be scaled during the render to fit the size - but if (as you may have found) CSS
					doesnt respect the ratio the images appear distorted - therefore the simplist fix: set the sizes via the HTML attributes width and height
