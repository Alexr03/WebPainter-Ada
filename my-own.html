Great work so far - this tutorial builds on all the work done you've completed so far and provides an excellent starting point to try to solve some of the problems assocated with the coursework.

We are introducing some new techniques in this tutorial -
1. event - the JavaScript keyword "event" (keywords were discussed in the previous lecture) is a reserved word that allows the programmer to get information about whats happening with regards to the mouse and/or keyboard.
    for more information on "events" please review https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event
2. clientX - this is a read only property (value) associated with the horizontal position of the "event" (covered above - specifically the mouseevent data of event)
    for more information on this (and the other properties please review: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/clientX
3. If you have issues with matching coordinates search "mouse coordinates and canvas coordinates not matching" only for possible published articles


An important note and something to think about:
    We have introduced a IF instruction in the mouse tracking function to detect whether the button is pressed; however try to answer the question:
    Why does the alert about the mouse button being pressed only happen if I am holding the button and moving the mouse?


Tasks:
    1. Spend some time reviewing this code - try to make sure you understand what is happening and why.
    2. Get this program running in Chrome and test it; make sure you have enabled the console and can see the "Debug Messages".
    3. Test what happens when you move the mouse over the canvas and press the left button.
    4. We have reintroduced the function fnPaintStylus (from the etch-a-sketch tutorial) as it paints a small rectangle on the canvas, see if you can connect the tracking function to the painting function so that when the user presses the mouse button the system will trace the movement of the mouse while painting
    5. Make sure your paint marks are located directly below your mouse, otherwise its hard to paint!
    6. Add the ability to change colour
    7. Add the ability to change brush size

    Try to complete the tasks before the next session
